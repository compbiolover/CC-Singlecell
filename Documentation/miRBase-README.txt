The miRBase Sequence Database -- Release 22.1
---------------------------------------------

Release 22.1 of miRBase represents a minor update of miRBase to
accompany the paper accepted for publication in the 2019 Database
Issue of Nucleic Acids Research. The only difference from release 22
is an update of the deep sequencing datasets mapped against miRBase
sequences. This leads to a re-calculation of the high confidence miRNA
set. There are no changes to the sequences or any other annotation.
